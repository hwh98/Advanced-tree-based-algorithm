# Advanced-tree-based-algorithm
A Matlab implementation and comparison of three tree based algorithms, binary search tree, AVL tree, and Red-Black tree.


The time and space computational complexity of binary search tree, AVL tree, and Red-black tree.

The insertion operation copmarison.
Algorithm | Time complexity | Space computational complexity
--- | --- | --- |
Binary search tree | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$|
AVL tree |  $O(log(n))$ | $O(n)$ |
Red-black tree | $O(log(n))$ | $O(n)$ |

The searching operation comparison.
Algorithm | Time complexity | Space computational complexity
--- | --- | --- |
Binary search tree | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$|
AVL tree |  $O(log(n))$ | $O(n)$ |
Red-black tree | $O(log(n))$ | $O(n)$ |
